# MIRTdata
https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRTdata

This repo contains data files for demos and tests
for the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox (MIRT),
both the Julia and Matlab versions:
* https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl
* https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt

Keeping data files in this repo ensures that the above code repos are small.

This repo is not really intended for cloning.
Instead, MIRT demos and tests download data from this repo as needed.
